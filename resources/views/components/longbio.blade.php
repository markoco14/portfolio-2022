            I started learning web development in December 2020. I've
            had an obsession with apps and web services since the end
            of my university days, but I always thought it was too late
            for me to learn. One day it hit me that I need to just start.
            Just start learning and see if is truly too late.

            A year and a half later, and I'm still just as passionate
            for coding things as when I started. A year and a half later,
            and I'm still every bit as grateful for the plethora of online
            learning platforms out there that helped me learn.

            I'm a full-stack developer living in Taipei. 
            Over the last 7 months, I have worked with 
            different teams at a local company. We used 
            React and Laravel to build Sales and Marketing 
            tools for internal use. 
        </p>

            I build side-projects in my spare time and 
            recently completed my largest project to date: 
            ExpenSave (an expense tracker). I love all 
            stages of development; from dreaming up ideas and 
            sketching designs, to writing code, completing 
            features, and receiving user feedback.

            I am currently looking for full-time or 
            part-time opportunities. I'm available to 
            work remotely but also able to work in the 
            office in Taiwan.

            If you are interested in how I can help 
            you, please feel free to contact me. I 
            look forward to hearing from you.
